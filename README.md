### Installation

You can install this package using different package managers as a `dev` dependency.

1. Using `yarn`:

   ```shell
   yarn add -D node-env-types
   ```

2. Using `npm`:

   ```shell
   npm i --save-dev node-env-types
   ```

3. Using `pnpm`:

   ```shell
   pnpm add -D node-env-types
   ```

4. Using `bun`:

   ```shell
   bun add -d node-env-types
   ```

### Usage

After installing this package you can use it as follows:

```ts
import load from 'node-env-types'
import process = 'process'

load(process.cwd(), {
  filename: ".env", // the path name of the file that contains your environmental variables
});

```

> We recommend calling `createEnvTypes(rootPath: string, options?: Options)` immediately after your imports. Note that `env-types` will be generated after you run the code for the first time, and you must have an `.env` file or equivalent in your project.

Alternatively you can load environmental variables for the default `.env` file as follows without even calling the load function as follows:

```ts
import "node-env-types/load";
```

### Console output

The during generation of `env-types` you can see the output on the console which looks similar to this:

```shell
 *** loading environment variables from C:\Users\crisp\OneDrive\Documents\npm\node-env-types\.env.

 *** created env-types at C:\Users\crisp\OneDrive\Documents\npm\node-env-types\env.d.ts.
```

### Parameters

The `createEnvTypes` function takes two optional parameters:

1. `rootPath` - A string indicating the directory path where your `.env` file is located. The default value is the current working directory (`process.cwd()`).

2. `options` - An optional object of type `Options` containing additional configuration options.

### Options

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                                       | Default Value   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `filename`   | This is optional, for example you can load your environmental variables from a file called `.env-prod`. If not provided the default will be used. | `.env`          |
| `outputPath` | This defines the path where you want your declarative TypeScript file to be output during types generation.                                       | `process.cwd()` |

### Common problems

- Sometimes you may not get **auto-completion** even if you have generated the `.d.ts` file. All you have to do is to open your `tsconfig.json` file, go to `includes`, and make sure that your `.d.ts` file is listed there. For example, if your `env.d.ts` file is generated in the root directory, your `includes` array in `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "./src/**/*.ts",
    "src/configs/test.ts",
    "env.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

Alternatively you can pass an empty array or point to the `root` folder of your project instead of `src` as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": ["./**/*.tsx", "./**/*.ts", "src/configs/test.ts", "env.d.ts"]
}
```

- Before calling the `createEnvTypes()` functions make sure that you have a `.env` file in your root project of your folder, this is the default file `node-env-types` will be looking for, If environment variables are named differently, make sure that you specify the correct `filename` in the options.

# node-env-types

ðŸŒ€ This package generates the typescript types for environment variables by reading your `.env` file.

</p>

> Note that this package also loads newly added `environmental` variables when you restart your typescript server.

### Installation

You can install this package using different package manager as a `dev` dependency.

1. using `yarn`

```shell
yarn add -D node-env-types
```

2. using `npm`

```shell
npm i --save-dev node-env-types
```

### Usage

After installing this package you can use it as follows:

```ts
import loadEvTypes from 'node-env-types'
import process = 'process'

createEnvTypes(process.cwd(), {
  filename: ".env", // the path name of the file that contains your environmental variables
});

```

> We recommend to call the `createEnvTypes(rootPath: string, options?: Options)` just at soon after your imports. Note that `env-types` will be generated after you have run the code for the first time and you must have an `.env` file or equivalent in your project.

### Console output

The during generation of `env-types` you can see the output on the console which looks similar to this:

```shell
 *** loading environment variables from C:\Users\crisp\OneDrive\Documents\npm\node-env-types\.env.

 *** created env-types at C:\Users\crisp\OneDrive\Documents\npm\node-env-types\env.d.ts.
```

### Parameters

The `createEnvTypes` takes two parameters which are both optional,

1. `rootPath` - types of string where your `.env` file will be located and the default is your current working directory `process.cwd()`.

2. `options` - type `Option` which is an object of options.

### Options

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th><th>Description</th><th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>filename</td><td>This is optional, for example ypu can load your environmental variables from a file called .env-prod. If not provided the default will be used.</td><td>.env</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>outputPath</td><td>This defines the path where you want your declarative typescript file to be outputed during types generations.</td><td>process.cwd()</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Common problems

- Sometimes you may not get `auto-completion` even if you have generated the `.d.ts` file. All you have to do is to open your `tsconfig.json` file under `includes` make sure that your `.d.ts` file is there in the array for example in my `env.d.ts` which is generated in the root i can have `includes` array to look as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "./src/**/*.ts",
    "src/configs/test.ts",
    "env.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

Alternatively you can pass an empty array or point to the `root` folder of your project instead of `src` as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": ["./**/*.tsx", "./**/*.ts", "src/configs/test.ts", "env.d.ts"]
}
```

- Before calling the `createEnvTypes()` functions make sure that you have a `.env` file in your root project of your folder, this is the default file `node-env-types` will be looking for, If environment variables are named differently, make sure that you specify the correct `filename` in the options.
